            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>It all started with Colonel Harland Sanders creating a finger lickin’ good recipe more than 75 years ago. 
                A list of secret herbs and spices scratched out on the back of his kitchen door, that continues to be followed across 
                145 countries, with more than 800,000 team members breading and freshly preparing bucket after bucket of our signature 
                Hot & Crispy chicken. The Colonel’s Secret Recipe continues to be as guarded; and our commitment towards Food, People and Planet remains as steadfast. 
                With a new KFC restaurant opening every 6 hours, we power on to serve the World’s Tastiest Chicken!
